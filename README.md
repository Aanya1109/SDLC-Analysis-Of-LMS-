SDLC Analysis of Learning Management System (LMS)

Repository Overview

This repository contains the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) comparative analysis report for a Learning Management System (LMS). The report studies how different SDLC models can be applied to the development of an LMS platform and evaluates their suitability based on requirements, risk handling, flexibility, and validation process.

The work is prepared as part of the Software Engineering course assignment.



Repository Structure

This repository maintains version history of the report using GitHub branching:

INITIAL_LMS_REPORT.docx — Initial draft version of the LMS SDLC analysis report
FINAL_LMS_REPORT.docx — Final reviewed and corrected version after improvements, formatting fixes, and validation updates
README.md — Repository description and structure documentation


SDLC Models Covered in the Report

The report includes comparative analysis of the following SDLC models:

* Waterfall Model
* Incremental Model
* Spiral Model

Each model is analyzed with respect to LMS development, including:

* Functional and non-functional requirements
* Requirements engineering process
* Requirements validation strategy
* Challenges in requirement validation
* Model suitability for LMS systems



Version Control Approach

This repository follows a structured version control workflow:

* Initial report uploaded to main branch
* Final revised report uploaded through a separate branch
* Changes merged using Pull Request workflow

This demonstrates practical use of GitHub branching and merging as part of SDLC best practices.



Purpose of the Report

The objective of this report is to:

* Understand SDLC model differences
* Apply SDLC concepts to an LMS platform
* Compare model suitability for educational systems
* Study requirements engineering and validation methods
* Demonstrate structured documentation and version control
